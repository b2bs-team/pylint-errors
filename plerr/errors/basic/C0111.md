## C0111 (missing-docstring)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def foo():
    pass
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def foo():
    """A dummy description."""
    pass
```

### Rationale:

Documentation Strings (called "docstrings") help you understand the intention of a module, function, class or method.

The chances that you will remember what each part of your code does is slim. Using docstrings will save you time and troubleshooting. Even the most descriptive function name (i.e. create_effective_rate_history()) will need a guide to its parameters.

Docstrings are helpful when using autodoc options in programs like Sphinx, so you, as the programmer, only have to describe a thing once.

The definitive guide to docstrings is PEP 257. There is a good guide to documenting Python signatures at the Sphinx Domains page.
